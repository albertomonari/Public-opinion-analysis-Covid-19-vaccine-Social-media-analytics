The aim of this project is to analyse public opinion regarding the covid-19 vaccine.
The analysis is based on 207719 tweets over a time range of 15 hours (first tweet: 2021-01-24 19:41:23 UTC; last tweet: 2021-01-25 10:30:37 UTC) in English containing the word ‘vaccine’ to analyse public opinion.

The project was done using R, exported to an annotated [R Markdown](tweets_vaccine.rmd) document and finally converted to [HTML](https://albertomonari.github.io/Public-opinion-analysis-Covid-19-vaccine-Social-media-analytics/).

The notebook is divided into the following parts:
- time range analysis
- twitter text analysis
- topic modeling
- sentiment analysis
- word network plot
- sentiment analysis based on emotions
